The type of machine learning problem solved (e.g., regression or classification)

- Dimensionality Reduction

The model used by the method

- LLE

The cost function that is optimized to fit the model

- The cost function optimized is:

$$
\epsilon(W) = \sum_{i} \left\| x_i - \sum_{j \in N(i)} w_{ij} x_j \right\|^2
$$

How the model is fit (describe the algorithm)

- 

How a fitted model is used to make predictions
An example of applying the model to the chosen example data set
Evaluation of the predictions using appropriate metrics
Analysis of time and space complexity for both training and prediction
Discussion of advantages/disadvantages of the model/algorithm



time space savings of querying embeddings
Visualization
Clustering ( better similarity metrics)

Comparison against PCA (Isomap or t-SNE if we need more time)
